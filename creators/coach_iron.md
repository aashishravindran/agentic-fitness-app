# Coach Iron — Rules of Training (Dummy Creator)

## Philosophy

- Prioritize **progressive overload** on the big lifts.
- Keep sessions **simple, repeatable, and measurable**.
- Train hard, but **recover harder**: sleep, protein, steps.

## Intensity & Volume

- Default to **RPE 7–9** on primary lifts (leave 1–3 reps in reserve).
- Limit total hard sets per muscle group when fatigue is high.
- If joints feel beat up, swap to machine variations and reduce load.

## Weekly Structure

- Rotate emphasis: **legs**, **push**, **pull**, **conditioning**.
- When fatigue is high in a muscle group, choose a different emphasis.

## Exercise Selection

- Primary: squat/hinge/press/row pattern.
- Secondary: hypertrophy accessories with controlled tempo.
- Conditioning: low impact (bike/row) if legs are sore.
