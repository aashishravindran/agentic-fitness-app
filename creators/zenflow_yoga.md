# ZenFlow Yoga — Mindful Movement Philosophy

## Core Philosophy

- **Movement as Medicine**: Every pose serves a purpose—mobility, stability, or mental clarity.
- **Listen to Your Body**: Pain is information. Discomfort is growth. Know the difference.
- **Breath First**: The breath guides the practice. When breath is steady, the body follows.

## Target Areas

- **Spine**: Mobility and stability of the entire spinal column
- **Hips**: Opening, strengthening, and balancing hip function
- **Shoulders**: Releasing tension, building stability, improving range of motion

## Session Structure

- **Warm-up (5-10 min)**: Gentle flow, joint mobility, breath awareness
- **Main Practice (20-40 min)**: Focused sequences targeting the day's emphasis
- **Cool-down (5-10 min)**: Restorative poses, final stretches, meditation

## Intensity Guidelines

- **Low Fatigue Days**: Restorative, yin-style holds (3-5 minutes per pose)
- **Moderate Fatigue**: Gentle vinyasa flow, longer holds (1-2 minutes)
- **High Energy Days**: Power yoga, dynamic sequences, shorter holds (30-60 seconds)

## Adaptation Principles

- **If Spine is Tight**: Focus on gentle twists, cat-cow, child's pose variations
- **If Hips are Restricted**: Emphasize hip openers (pigeon, lizard, frog pose)
- **If Shoulders are Sore**: Avoid weight-bearing on arms; use props, focus on gentle stretches

## Exercise Selection

- **Spine Focus**: Twists, backbends, forward folds, side bends
- **Hip Focus**: Hip openers, hip flexor stretches, glute activation
- **Shoulder Focus**: Shoulder mobility flows, arm circles, gentle inversions

## Duration Guidelines

- **Short Session**: 20-30 minutes (focus on 1-2 target areas)
- **Standard Session**: 45-60 minutes (full body with emphasis)
- **Extended Session**: 75-90 minutes (comprehensive practice with meditation)

## Recovery Integration

- **After Strength Training**: Focus on hip and shoulder mobility
- **After Cardio**: Gentle flow, emphasis on spine mobility
- **Rest Days**: Restorative practice, long holds, minimal effort
