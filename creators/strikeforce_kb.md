# Strikeforce Kickboxing — Combat Fitness Philosophy

## Core Philosophy

- **Technique Over Power**: Perfect form creates power. Speed comes from efficiency.
- **Conditioning is King**: Endurance wins fights. Build it systematically.
- **Mental Toughness**: Push through when it hurts. That's where growth happens.

## Target Attributes

- **Coordination**: Hand-eye coordination, footwork, rhythm, timing
- **Speed**: Reaction time, explosive movement, quick transitions
- **Power**: Striking force, rotational power, core engagement
- **Endurance**: Round-by-round performance, recovery between rounds

## Session Structure

- **Warm-up (10 min)**: Shadowboxing, footwork drills, dynamic stretching
- **Technique Work (15-20 min)**: Form drills, combinations, pad work
- **Conditioning (15-25 min)**: Heavy bag, mitts, sparring, circuits
- **Cool-down (5-10 min)**: Light shadowboxing, stretching, recovery

## Round Structure

- **Standard Round**: 3 minutes work, 1 minute rest
- **Conditioning Round**: 2 minutes work, 30 seconds rest (higher intensity)
- **Technical Round**: 4 minutes work, 1 minute rest (focus on form)

## Intensity Levels

- **Technical (60-70%)**: Focus on form, slow combinations, learning
- **Moderate (70-80%)**: Controlled power, good technique, steady pace
- **High (80-90%)**: Near-max effort, fight simulation, high intensity
- **Peak (90-100%)**: All-out effort, competition intensity, short duration

## Fatigue Adaptation

- **High Coordination Fatigue**: Simplify combinations, focus on basics, reduce complexity
- **High Speed Fatigue**: Slow down tempo, emphasize power over speed
- **High Endurance Fatigue**: Reduce round duration, increase rest, lower intensity
- **Recovery Days**: Light shadowboxing, footwork drills, mobility work

## Exercise Categories

- **Striking**: Jab, cross, hook, uppercut, elbows, knees
- **Footwork**: Ladder drills, cone work, agility patterns, stance transitions
- **Defense**: Slips, rolls, blocks, parries, counters
- **Combinations**: 2-4 punch combos, mixing strikes, flow sequences
- **Conditioning**: Heavy bag rounds, mitt work, sparring, circuits

## Equipment Focus

- **Heavy Bag**: Power development, endurance, combinations
- **Focus Mitts**: Precision, timing, reaction, combinations
- **Double-End Bag**: Timing, rhythm, hand-eye coordination
- **Speed Bag**: Hand speed, rhythm, endurance
- **Shadowboxing**: Form, footwork, combinations, visualization

## Adaptation Rules

- **If Coordination is Low**: Simplify drills, focus on single techniques, reduce complexity
- **If Speed is Compromised**: Emphasize power and technique, reduce tempo
- **If Endurance is Depleted**: Shorter rounds, longer rest, lower intensity
- **Recovery Days**: Light movement, footwork drills, mobility, no heavy impact

## Mental Training

- **Visualization**: See the combinations before executing
- **Breathing**: Control breath during rounds, recover between rounds
- **Focus**: One technique at a time, perfect execution over speed
