# Inferno HIIT — High-Intensity Training Philosophy

## Core Philosophy

- **Maximum Effort, Minimum Time**: Work hard, recover hard. Efficiency is key.
- **Progressive Overload**: Each session should challenge you more than the last.
- **Recovery is Training**: The work happens in the rest periods. Respect them.

## Target Systems

- **Cardiovascular**: Heart rate zones, VO2 max development, aerobic capacity
- **CNS (Central Nervous System)**: Power output, reaction time, mental fatigue
- **Metabolic**: Fat burning, metabolic conditioning, EPOC (afterburn effect)

## Session Structure

- **Warm-up (5 min)**: Dynamic movement, activation, heart rate elevation
- **Work Phase (15-30 min)**: High-intensity intervals with structured rest
- **Cool-down (5-10 min)**: Active recovery, stretching, heart rate normalization

## Work-to-Rest Ratios

- **Beginner**: 1:2 or 1:3 (e.g., 20s work, 40s rest)
- **Intermediate**: 1:1 (e.g., 30s work, 30s rest)
- **Advanced**: 2:1 or 3:1 (e.g., 40s work, 20s rest)

## Intensity Zones

- **Zone 1 (Recovery)**: 50-60% max heart rate
- **Zone 2 (Aerobic)**: 60-70% max heart rate
- **Zone 3 (Tempo)**: 70-80% max heart rate
- **Zone 4 (Threshold)**: 80-90% max heart rate
- **Zone 5 (VO2 Max)**: 90-100% max heart rate

## Fatigue Management

- **High CNS Fatigue**: Reduce intensity, increase rest, focus on Zone 2-3 work
- **High Cardio Fatigue**: Lower volume, longer rest periods, avoid Zone 5
- **Recovery Days**: Active recovery in Zone 1-2, mobility work, light movement

## Exercise Selection

- **Cardio Focus**: Running intervals, bike sprints, rowing, assault bike
- **Full Body**: Burpees, mountain climbers, jumping jacks, bear crawls
- **Lower Body**: Squat jumps, lunge jumps, box jumps, sprints
- **Upper Body**: Push-up variations, battle ropes, medicine ball slams

## Session Types

- **Tabata**: 20s work, 10s rest, 8 rounds (4 minutes total)
- **EMOM (Every Minute on the Minute)**: Work at top of minute, rest remainder
- **AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible)**: Fixed time, max rounds
- **Circuit**: Multiple exercises, minimal rest between, repeat rounds

## Adaptation Rules

- **If CNS is Fried**: Reduce intensity to Zone 2-3, increase rest, shorter session
- **If Cardio is Depleted**: Focus on active recovery, avoid high-intensity work
- **If Both are High**: Full rest day or Zone 1 active recovery only
